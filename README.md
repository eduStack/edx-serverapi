edx-serverapi
=============

This repository is the intended home of a new HTTP-based programming interface for the Open edX LMS server, which is currently under development by the Solutions Team @ edX.  You are free to peruse and poke at the code, and by all means send us feedback!  

Please note, however, that the current body of work reflected here is a snapshot in time of the current implementation, which has already changed a fair amount.  It is our plan to move all development of the edX Server API to this repository by the end of 2014-Q3.
